        <p>Hello! My first name is Ronald but I go by Justyn. Just wanted to get that out of the way <strong><em style="color: #4F0714;">now</em></strong>, before it confuses everybody. I am currently living in Chicago, IL and I am a software engineering student at Thinkful.</p>

      <h2 class = "aboutme">About Justyn</h2>
        <p>I attended a few semesters of college after graduating from high school but ended up going down a different path. I have: <!--list past work experience-->
        </p>
          <ul><li>Worked in retail</li>
              <li>Worked in warehouses</li>
              <li>Became a flatbed truck driver</li>
              <li>Installed ADT home security systems</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="about">Over the past 10 years, and now I am here!</p>
        <p>I developed an interest in software engineering in 2016 and finally decided to pursue that interest in 2022. Team work makes the dream work, as does my virtual reality headset and boxing/kickboxing workouts. </p>
        <p>I am excited, and looking forward to being a part of any development team, that will allow me to learn and experience as many projects as possible so that I can become the most effective software engineer I can possibly be!</p>
